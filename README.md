### AI Folder Description

The **`ai/`** folder contains all the guidelines and general information needed to work with AI agents. It is the
primary place to look when setting up or managing agents.

### How to Use

1. **Guidelines**: All important instructions for using AI agents are stored in
   the [global_guidelines.md](ai/global_guidelines.md) file. Refer to this file for detailed steps and information.

2. **General Configuration**: Any shared configurations for AI agents are also included here. Check the folder if you
   need common settings for multiple agents.

3. **Agent-Specific Configuration**:
  - Each agent has its own folder.
  - If an agent needs specific settings, those are kept in its dedicated folder.
